# ModifiedSalesData
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze the sales data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights by summarizing and aggregating the data. The key tasks include:
1.	Time-Based Aggregation: Summarize sales data by month, quarter, and day to understand seasonal trends and daily performance.
2.	Product Category Analysis: Aggregate sales by product categories to identify which categories contribute the most to revenue.
3.	Visualization: Create visualizations to represent trends and insights clearly.

Data Set used: Modified Big SalesData

Key Steps for the Project
1. Data Loading and Exploration
•	Load the dataset in Excel.
•	Explore the dataset to understand its structure, columns, and data types.
•	Check for missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
•	Perform transformations to make data suitable for EDA and Visualization.
2. Time-Based Aggregation
•	Convert the date column (if available) to a datetime format.
•	Aggregate sales data by month, quarter, and day to analyze trends over time.

Potential Challenges
1.	Data Cleaning: Ensure the dataset is clean and free of missing or inconsistent values.
2.	Time Zone Handling: If the dataset includes data from multiple regions, handle time zones appropriately.
3.	Outliers: Identify and handle outliers that may skew the analysis.




DataSet Source: Big Sales Data (Kaggle)
Tools used: Python, PowerQuery,  Excel and PowerBI

Operations performed on the original dataset:
1.	Renaming the columns.
2.	Splitting address into multiple columns to ensure faster querying.
3.	Removed unnecessary columns.
4.	Aggregating the partial sums to get order total
5.	Splitting the table into two for normalization and to avoid duplication. 

Insights and Recommendations
•	Summarize the findings from the analysis.
•	Provide actionable insights, such as:
o	Best-performing months/quarters for sales.
o	Product categories to focus on for revenue growth.
o	Days of the week with the highest sales.


Expected Outcomes
•	A clear understanding of sales trends over time.
•	Insights into the performance of different product categories.
•	Visualizations that communicate the findings effectively.
